Pay attention, for this is the class of spells that you can use even before accreditation because of their protective nature, and are the fundamentals of every vulnerable spellweaver. This textbook is the third tome, and focuses on higher-level spellcasting that requires large amount of aether and control."</td>

This can result in individuals who aren't usually blessed with the weave to be able to cast spells of equal strength, though this requires the spellcaster in question to be of equal devotion to the deity in question. This advanced textbook will go into the most powerful and advnaced spells usually granted to the most devoted of clerics.  "</td>
