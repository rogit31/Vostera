                <h1>Faceless Cloak</h1>
                <p>The faceless cloak is an enchanted black cloak that hides the wearer's face. There are several known versions of this hooded cloak; some look plain and common, while others appear intricate and expensive. When the hood is raised, a minor illusion appears which hides the wearer's face in total darkness. The wearer can see out with no penalties, but only truesight or other magical means of seeing through illusions can penetrate the hood's darkness from outside.</p>
                <p>It is worth 100 gold.</p>
