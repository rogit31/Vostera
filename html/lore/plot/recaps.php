            <h2>April 19<sup>th</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>Last time we met, you started off by discussing a meeting Lucina was going to have with her brother Lucius. You devised a plan in case things went wrong, and had her meet her brother at the beach. Lucius gave her the rundown of the main goals of the order, but could not give more information without having her enroll and take an oath. He gave you a day to think about it. When you came back to the beach hut on Tephia, you discussed further before being interrupted by Raoul coming back with Jone's kid as well as Magnus, Meg's little brother. After some time to catch up and chit-chat, you were once again interrupted by a building inspector who turned out to be Vespera Argent in disguise. She claims to have followed Raoul to your hut, and wanted to make a deal. With parliamentary elections happening in a month or so, she wanted to assure victory by putting national security into the public eye even further, which has been at the crux of her campaign. You are to rob the ninth tome of genesis and the planewalker's corpse from the sundown monastery, situated on an island on the west coast of Eloran. She would then blame the crimes you committed onto the Order, giving the parliament good reason to commit to a government with a stronger focus on defense, take control over the empire's parliament, pardon you for your crimes and make you free once you completed your mission. She gave you a day to think about it. You took some time to discuss your decision further. That night Lucina contacted Lua once more, and found out that the leader of the Order is named Zeke Ashir, a direct descendent of the Ashirs. She also made it clear the members of the order were heretics to be cleansed. The next day, you refused Lucius's offer, as it would take a pact that you were not willing to take. He seemed angry but understanding, as instead you gave him further information about the remaining books of genesis, but lying about the ninth tome, which you successfully hid from him. As you hugged him goodbye, Lua insisted you kill him were he stood, but you kept your calm and told him your goodbyes. We ended the session there, with your decision about whether to take Vespera's deal or not still hanging. </p>

            <h2>April 5<sup>th</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>Last time we played, you had just arrived in Onarx to try and find a solution to Hemlock's coma. Hemlock had some visions where he met Vero once more, and was asked what truths he was seeking. Lucina and meg disguised themselves, and went for a visit to the church of vero. You had a seance with Emir, who enlightened you on your options. You traded some secrets for an elixir of truth, that would supposedly help Hemlock become a truthseer if he wished to become one. After your seance, you decided to go for some shopping, and headed to Tony's, a shop specially made for hunters and huntresses looking to upgrade their gear. Terry Dodson, an employee at Tony's helped you find all the gear you desired and was truly a model employee. You wrote a nice review after tricking him into selling you gear at a discount, left and rejoined with Hemlock after a short trip across the Leife seas. You administered Hemlock the truth elixir as soon as you came back. Hemlock was informed of the choice given to him by Vero, and after asking a bunch more questions decided to become a truthseer. An eye sprouted in the middle of his forehead, he was returned to his previous wisdom, and he was granted the ability to have true vision once per day. Lucina was contacted by Lucius, telling her that he had some news for her and that he was going to pick her up tomorrow. Lucina prayed to Lua before going to bed, and was met with a cold and unsatisfied deity.</p>

            <h2>March 22<sup>nd</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>From Tephia, you headed out into the jungle to find the cave you encountered earlier in your travels with an altar to Vero. You read some books, practiced the flute, and Meg visited her younger brother Magnus in his dreams. After a few days of peaceful travel, you arrived at the cave, where Lucina got caught by a trap, starting the fall of the cave. The trap also caused you to be noticed by a necromancer goblin that was in the cave as you walked in. You immediately started fighting him, as he summoned some skeletons that you dealt with thanks to Lua's edge mostly. Once you actually got a hold of him through the rocks and the smoke, he called forth his 'ultimate creation', a modified Aboleth. The worm mind controlled Hemlock, who shot an arrow through Lucina's stomach, before all of you started taking big chunks of damage forcing you to retreat to the other side of the cave. Thanks to some healing, faerie fires, and Lucina's channel divinity, you stayed alive and managed to eventually wear the Aboleth down and finish him with one last arrow. As the cave was starting to crumble, you quickly went for the altar, and started asking questions. You got the locations of all of the tomes of genesis, of Khava, confirmed that Hemlock's mother was alive, and figured that Vespera was the one that murdered Hemlock's father.</p>
            <p>As the cave threatened to bury you, you took your hand away from the altar, with Lucina's spell keeping you alive once more. You fled from the altar, successfully dodging the falling rocks. Once out of dodge, you realized that Hemlock was in a state of madness, reducing his wisdom to one. Realizing this is a situation you needed to remedy immediately, you started asking for solutions. You pleaded with Lua, who answered you that Hemlock would need to atone with Vero. Figuring some of Vero's clerics may be of help, you charted a boat to Onarx, left Hemlock back at your safe base and we stopped the session there. </p>
            <h2>March 1<sup>st</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>You found out more about the happenings at the underbelly. You fought Raoul as he blamed you for the downfall of The Underbelly as an organization. After you defeated him, he acquiesced and answered any questions you had to the best of his ability. After a night of drinking and partying, Meg also threatened him and intimidated him into bringing his brother back. He once again agreed. The day after, he gave you some gifts, including a box containing a note, a magical flute, and three spell scrolls. You burned the soft spot down and left for Tephia. You also learned that Hemlock's mother was still alive.</p>

            <h2>February Friday 9<sup>th</sup> and Monday 12<sup>th</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>With some new trinkets in hand, you traveled all the way back to Titanfall. You stopped by Aria's lake, and with some new spells and the possibility of diving to the bottom with the masks of arcane breathing, you were able to peek into what sat at the bottom of Aria's lake. It turns out, some fish people seem to be having somewhat of a perpetual party at the bottom of this lake. Meg successfully courted one of the fish people, Lucina seemed to attract their anger as splitting their lake in half probably wasn't very nice to them. Hemlock finally managed to pet some of the deer. You then moved on from Aria's forest, where you left Cheetoh behind. Wearing the masks, you ventured into titanfall's desert. You crossed paths with the skeleton you had seen before and stashed his skull into your bag of holding before moving on. You managed to sneak by all of the watchtower's spotlights and got into the first watchtower where you brutally murdered four guards with protective clothing above their leather armor. One of your spells accidentally set off some arcane effect that shone the spotlights onto you. You decided to maneuver through the towers to another tower while reinforcements where sent to yours, and successfully managed to sneak into another turret, instantly killing one of the guards and intimidating the second one into helping you sneak into the facillity. </p>
            
            <p>You successfully snuck into the facility after stabbing Tim for good measure. After you had entered, Jone, one of the guards changing, noticed something odd about Meg's appearance and you promptly stabbed her, then accidentally turned her into a cat. You kept going into the facility where you dropped off Tim at the infirmary, where he tried to get a bit more money out of you but you managed to intimidate him into just taking it and leaving. With an almost dead human turned into a cat still in your hands, you snuck into the living quarters of the researchers and found Leia Rosenthorne. The slightly chubby woman with a karen cut with black hair and a high bridged nose took a bit of time to warm up to you but you eventually started talking about Titanfall and its secrets. She also warned you about the possibility of retribution against the Underbelly if things were to go south. Before too long, Vixal Blund came to check back into the living quarters, and noticed you in Leia's quarters because of a bad stealth check. He knocked the door down as he called for reinforcements and his hair fell off his head. You fought him for a few rounds before managing to escape to the underbelly soft spot. You tried to find Khava, but failed to do locate her. You also had with you Jone, the guard who you convicned this was Santa's workplace. The day after, she realized this was a lie and you tried to console her but she seemed very upset. You called Elwyn, trying to gain some more information and a safe spot for Leia. You were informed that he was also on the run at the moment as things have started to get heated in Aegur as well. You tried to sneak into the Soft Spot on the off-chance you might find someone to talk to, but instead were greeted with Raoul Ragimund seemingly waiting for you to arrive.</p>
            <h2>February Friday 2<sup>nd</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>After some careful investigation of the new security around Adenville, you went out to explore a little and learned that there was a speech heeded by general Argent tomorrow next to the now damaged academy building. You took this as an invitation to dive into the academy building. After some very interesting shenanigans with the librarian that was currently guarding the entrance to library itself, you managed to steal a bunch of books, including some from the restricted section. She did find you out after some bad checks, and you decided that the best way out was to brute force your way out since you were all invisible and couldn't find each other at this point anymore. Hemlock jumped out of the window, followed by Meg. The librarian tried to hold you back, but karma's a bitch and off a natural twenty, you nearly missed her brain with an arrow and she fled, calling for reinforcements. The reinforcements arrived while Hemlock and Meg were escaping, Hemlock chugged a potion of fire breathing and used it to mold the iron bars of the academy fence as well as instantly carbonize two guards that were on your tail. Lucina took this as an opportunity to sneak into the basement of the academy. After some very lucky rolls, you managed to steal a significant amount of things off from the basement, figured that they were probably transporting things to the titanfall site. On your way out, you were spotted by Vespera but she seemingly let you go.</p>
            
            <p>You snuck back into town hoping to get more information about Titanfall amongst other things from both the academy building and Lucina's parents. With some creative uses of flying and pass without a trace, you hopped over the city walls mario style and snuck into the local cemetary once more. You had to make some shenanigans happen with disguise self this time, buying out some guards and then trying to scare off some teenagers on their first date, which you did eventually manage to do but maybe not as smoothly as you had hoped. After realizing that there was nowhere to hide two full corpses in, you made the decision to simply decapitate the Lucina's parents and stuff the severed heads into your bags. You reconsecrated their graves and you split up for a moment letting Lucina have a moment at the silver moon church while you investigated the academy building. You found the building to be completely destroyed on one side, and tried to investigate into it but decided against it after a you caught the attention of some staff and students inside. You took the time to sneak back out and we ended the session there.</p>
            <h2>January 15<sup>th</sup> 2024</h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>You set out to adventure into Titanfall before realizing that the corrupted ground you stood on was draining you, making you sick, some more than others. Lucina called out to Lua for answers, where you learned that the very fabric of magic was corrupted here by something appearing as a small statue in a foetal position in the middle of the crater. You decided to scout out the edge of the crater. You found out that the crater seemed to be covered in illusory magic. You went back to the edge of the forest to find Cheetoh before finding your way back to Aria's lake, healing yourself and having Hemlock once again fail to pet the local wildlife. Walking all the way back to Adenville, you called Elwyn and he gave you some information about terrorist attacks happening in Adenville, as well as some information about the effects of Titanfall's mysterious sickness. You decided to send off Meg to the town and send a message to Dareej, who you correctly suspected of being part of the Order of the Black Sun. You met up with her and an unexpected guest, Lucius Aemon, who seems to be a part of this organization. While Lucina caught up with Lucius, Meg got caught by the peacekeepers guarding the gate, apparently wanted now, and got out suspiciously easily. Lucius and Dareej split, seemingly called by something before disappearing. You went to rest, and we ended the session there. </p>

            <h2>December 11<sup>th</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>With the knowledge that Lucina's brother Leucis knew of your whereabouts and was possibly looking for you, you decided that you needed to leave town in a hurry. You quickly contacted Adam for one last discussion. You talked about the possibility and the implications of the parenticide of the Aemons one on one. While you had this discussion, Meg chose to do some errands before leaving. </p>
            <p>After saying your goodbyes to Adam, you decided to steal and pillage some of the nearby crops and fruit trees for a little extra food for your trip accross the Arian forest. You got caught in doing so, and brought yourself the anger of an old lady.</p>
            <p>As you head out through the Arian woods, after your first night, the body of Vannan disappeared leaving behind Lua's Edge. During your travel, you encountered a troll singing nearby, you encountered some fruits that rendered you invisible, and a lake that was rumored to be the place where <a class="crosslink" href="#">Aria</a> serenaded <a href="#" class="crosslink">Layla</a>. You bathed and healed as Hemlock unsuccesfully attemped to befriend the local fauna.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, you failed to pass hidden from a group of bounty hunters that was aware of your presence and bounty. Hemlock came close to falling, but you were able to clutch up and made them run away instead.</p>
            <p>After a few more days of travel, you exhausted your rations and came close to the edge of the forest. A mysterious purple rain befell the forest, leaving an odd purple chalky residue. You felt the sensation of being intensely watched intensify, despite not finding anyone or anything watching you.</p>

                <h2>December 7<sup>th</sup></h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>You started off the session with you guys figuring out a way to get rid of the stolen boat you were on, the rolling thunder. You contacted Elwyn and figured that he could probably find a way to sell it, and you were right. After a while you did indeed manage to sell it off for 25000 gold total.</p>
                <p> You also came into contact with Adam Fawcett, the head of the silver moon church in Adenville. You managed to convince him to come out of town to help you find a cure for Pork’s affliction. He was able to help you out and Pork became Hemlock once again. He also informed Lucina that her parents were dead.</p>
                <p> Meanwhile, Vannan started having some visions of spiders. Wanting to know more about the demise of the Aemon family, you snuck back into the ashy city. You cashed out your cheque, got hit on by the banker and headed out to do a bit of grave robbing. With the graves of the Aemon family unearthed, you learned the culprit of the fire that killed Lucina’s parents was Leucis, Lucina’s own brother. You took some time to absorb this information as you explored the Aemon home.</p>
                <p> We had to cut the session off, so we time-skipped a bit to the next night. That night, Vannan decided his fate in front of The Fateweaver. He decided to go down fighting, and challenged Lua’s champion. He failed in the end, and took one last dip into the void before disappearing and leaving behind Lua’s Edge with a message for all of you, “Praise Lua”.

                <h2>November 26<sup>th</sup></h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>
                    You set off in the afternoon and figured out a way to get out of Vloren and into Adenville without getting noticed. You used an older man named Pork, aka Hemlock, to scout out your options. You ended up finding the rolling thunder, a ship filled with cargo, including silver and gold trinkets and a variety of natural materials. The ship also included an enslaved thunder elemental named Bob.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You met Meg, Robyn’s character, an Arakocra bard. You released Bob from his enslavement with a very high roll on disenchant magic from Lucina, at which point a fight broke out and Ben instantly died. Rukain /Rupal was paralyzed from an arrow from Hemlock and got pummeled to death by Bob. They both rolled natural 20s on their death saving throws, which means they healed to one hp, and while you were talking to Bob, they teleported out of the boat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite this, when Bob flew away, he spotted them in the water and instantly murdered them before floating off. You then managed to navigate your way close to Adenville before we ended the session there a tad early.

            <h2>November 12<sup>th</sup></h2>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>
                With some new gear under your belt, you set out to continue your adventure into the desert. You named your Tressym Cheetoh and have yet to decide for a party name. You made a few encounters that you mostly avoided until you reached a gigantic pile of reflective gold that was the property of Namix, a young brass dragon that has fashioned himself a pile of gold into a hostel.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the hostel, you read a plaque that heeded a warning, which you found out was located at Titanfall. After a relaxing evening, you found yourselves at a crossroads on how to proceed forward, and you opted to trade in the Tripal stone that was in your possession in exchange for an expedited flight to the edge of the desert.
            </p>
            <p>
                You got a call from Elwyn, who communicated some new information about the stone, notably that it seemed as if the stone wasn’t nullifying magic; instead, it was transferring it in some way. You exchanged some more information before heading into town, discovering that you are indeed wanted by the academy at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                You talked with some members of the silver moon church to find out more about whether the effects of Hemlock’s aging were reversible. You decided to take a boat to Adenville, found a deal thanks to Vannan.

        <h2>October 21<sup>th</sup></h2>
        <hr class="solid">
        <p>
            You spent your first night in the cave. Hemlock had a nightmare of a house burning down in flames, where he perceived his parents as well as a couple of people, including one shorter man and one taller woman.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day, you managed to find a portal that connects to the other side of the mountain chain. The password, activated by a riddle, took a while to accomplish, but eventually, with a little help, you managed to solve it. This granted you access to the other side of the Kaan mountains and saved three days of travel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once on the other side, you found a tressym that was wounded and fought an air elemental. Lucina also had a dream, which you were not privy to hearing. The next morning, you found a strange thread emanating from the stone in the direction that you were heading, towards the west. It faded in a few minutes as the sunrise glowed a strange purple.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day, you found an oasis that ended up being an illusion. The illusion was cast by an undead corpse inside a casket buried underneath it. The ghost begged you to free it from this plane as it was bound to its duty to protect a weapon from being stolen. You took a long rest, and as you woke up, the tripal stone shot several flame strikes from it at regular intervals before you casted create water around it, cooling down the stone and being eventually absorbed into the stone. This stopped the activity in the stone.
        </p>
        <p>
            You ended up murdering the ghost by using your newfound sword, Lua’s Edge. With a beam of light and a huge critical strike, he dissipated with a thank you. You talked with Elwyn about the events, and he said he would look into the stone’s activities.
