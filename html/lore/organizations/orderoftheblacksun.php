                <h1>Order of the Black Sun</h1>
                <p>The order of the black sun is a terrorist organization that recruits derelict spellweavers. They have commited several terrorist attacks against the <a href="ashirempire.php" class="crosslink">Ashir Empire</a> and more specifically the <a href="academyarcanum.php" class="crosslink">Academy Arcanum</a>. <a href="../people/leucisaemon.php" class="crosslink">Lucius Aemon</a> <a href="../people/dareej.php" class="crosslink">Dareej</a> are known members of the order.</p>

                    <h2 id="2">Ideology</h2>
                    <hr class="solid">
                    <p>The OBS' ideology is one of restarting the world. They believe the aetheric re-emergence is a blight upon this world and in order to avoid the disasters of the titanic era, it is best to cleanse the world of it's aether and start anew. Their objective is to rebuild the aether bomb of Aylin Ashir and remove the existence of spellweavers from Vostera. Secretely, only a few members know but there never was a a way to build an aether-only bomb. In fact, the reason why aether exists is because life requires it to exist. In order for aether to be cleansed, this would require the complete destruction of all living life.</p>
                    <p>They have this kind of martyr-like attitude about this, as if they were the only option available to this problem. They see themselves as the only solution to this tragic problem. They believe the cause of the Aetheric re-emergence was the survival of Aylin Ashir.</p>
                    <h2 id="3">Leadership</h2>
                    <hr class="solid">
                    <p>The currently known members of the OBS are Dareej and Lucius. Other members could include</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Founder</li>
                        <li>Propagandist</li>
                        <li>Operatives</li>
                        <li>Technomancer/Saboteur</li>
                        <li>Infiltrator</li>
                        <li>Inner circle</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Founder: Zeke Ashir</h3>
                    <p>A direct descendant of Aylin Ashir. A secretely survived child from <a href="../history/pheonixgate.php" class="crosslink">Pheonixgate</a>. He realizes that the fight for power and aether is never ending and the only way to end it is to finish what Aylin started.</p>
                    <h3>Propagandist</h3>
                    <p>Capri is a shapeshifter woman, very charismatic and ex academy.</p>
                    <h3>Operatives</h3>
                    <p>Dareej is one of them. Pax is another, human man with a scar over his right eyebrow, long brown hair, quiet in conversation. Mavel is another, goliath man with a friendly smile and tattoos covering his entire body. The players recognize him as one of the people detained in the avendor cellar.</p>
                    <h3>Technomancer/Saboteur</h3>
                    <p>Calisto. Elven woman with a background in aetherology. </p>
                    <h3>Infiltrator</h3>
                    <p>Lucius Aemon, as well as zander, a half-elven man with an arm missing. </p>
                    <h3>Inner Circle</h3>
                    <p>The OBS needs to know:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The existence of an aether bomb and thus the true origin of the world and genesis</li>
                        <li>The existence of the books of genesis and possibly their general location</li>
                        <li>Because they know about the lie of the genesis, they most likely believe in the gods but do not believe in their creation. "The gods didn't create us, we created them. It is undebatable that they give us incredible boons of divine power but their origin is as false as the academy's lies."</li>
                        <li>There are nine books of genesis, the last three of which that are required to build an aether bomb. The order already has one of the books thanks to their attack on Avendor, that happened thanks to their jailbreak getting so much attention. They were given fake information about the second book being in Adenville. They think the second book could be in the planewalker's grave in the sundown monastery. The third's books whereabouts are unknown. The academy purposefully has the books locations split up amongst different secure locations to reduce the chances of anyone getting all of them. They are contained in closed boxes that are immune to divination. They promise to give CO answers and knowledge about the world if they complete a certain task? Probably related to titanfall so they can discover more about that. </li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="#4">History</h2>
                    <hr class="solid">
                    <p>The ashirian secret is that the survival of Aylin and Nola ashir was the reason for the regeneration of the weave. The Hudal family used this information to win a case against the Ashirs that dethroned them, effectively putting the blame on them for the creation of the academy, the regeneration of the weave and the preferential treatment of spellweavers. The Hudals promised a change from the ashirian administration, which to some extent did happen. Their politics were focused around the relaxing of academy control, the slow of the ashirian expansion and a focus on internal affairs. The Hudals see the aetheric re-emergence as a dangerous myth that from the past that can and should be ignored. They are seen as more modern and progressive, but some see their policies as soft and forgiving. Vespera Argent is the modern more conservative equivalent, that bases her popularity on the idea of the rebuild of the Ashirian expansion. Zeke Ashir is an illegitimate child of the Ashirs that survived the culling of the Ashir family centuries ago during their trial. He knows about the Ashirian secret and created the OBS as a way to deal with the aetheric re-emergence. He wants to recreate the original explosion Aylin Ashir caused, but without having any survivors, to fully erase the weave and hopefully restart the world without magic. </p>

                        <li>Hi meg! I haven't written to you in a while, I'ts been busy... I have been working for this new lady in the clarit Hills! I like it... Their house is super big and shiny! Their kids are kind of mean but I don't mind it too much. I have my own room now! And I filled it with drawings and some plants. My new boss, Nolwen Argent is a bit strict though and even though I wanted to adopt a kitten she didn't let me. But that's ok, with some of the money you sent me I'm hoping to go to school someday! I even managed to talk to some of the people at the academy here and they think I might have a chance! Especially if I get on miss Argent's good side she told me she could help me with getting in! Let me know how you're doing, and where you're at right now, I hope you'll be able to experience the beautiful weather in Avendor sometime. Miss you Meg.
