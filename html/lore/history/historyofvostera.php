                <p>In the beginning, there was <a href="../gods/kaos.php" class="crosslink">Kaos, The Godfather</a>, the sole entity to exist in the vast universe. The god of time, eternity, the cosmos, and existence itself, Kaos populated the cosmos with his sons and daughters, the stars. Among them, <a href="../gods/sola.php" class="crosslink">Sola, The Sunmother</a>, and <a href="../gods/vero.php" class="crosslink">Vero, The Truth</a>. Sola, feeling the weight of solitude in the vast expanse, birthed the planets, and among them, Vostera, a world destined to play a pivotal role in the cosmic drama.

                <h2 id="2">Titanic Age</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>Sola lovingly bathed Vostera in her radiant light, and from the primordial glow emerged the Titans, majestic and colossal beings of aether, nature, and light. With each step they took, mountains rose, canyons formed, oceans swelled, and volcanoes erupted, shaping the very landscape of Vostera. Yet, for all their grandeur, the Titans were bereft of consciousness, speech, emotion, or the ability to reproduce. Their singular purpose was to bask in the radiance of Sola's light, and in their mindlessness, they engaged in endless battles, sparking The Titanic Wars.</p>
                <h2 id="3">Titanic Wars</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>For centuries, these Titan clashes raged on, their magnitude beyond mortal comprehension, and the scars of these epic conflicts still linger as a testament to their power. The discord among Sola's creations saddened her deeply, witnessing the mindless battles fought over her precious gift of light. Filled with disappointment, anger, and frustration, Sola withdrew, entering a state of dormancy known as The Thousand Year Winter. During this time, all Titans perished, unable to survive without their life-giving connection to Sola's light.</p>
                <h2 id="4">Planewalker's Age</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>Upon awakening from her slumber, Sola, in her wisdom and compassion, decided to grant life on Vostera a second chance. The era of The Titanic Wars came to an end, making way for a new age—the contemporary era of Vostera. Sola, with the aid of her brother Vero, bestowed additional gifts upon her creations. She granted them the capacity for speech, conscious thought, empathy, and the ability to love one another, hoping they would embrace her gift in harmony.</p>
                <p>From the diverse environments of Vostera arose distinct humanoid races. The woods gave birth to the graceful elves, the mountains to the resilient dwarves, the plains to the resourceful humans, the jungles to the formidable orcs, the tundras to the nimble halflings, the desert to the majestic dragonborn, and the beaches to the enigmatic tieflings, among others. Amidst this tapestry of life, one extraordinary humanoid emerged— <a href="../people/planewalker.php" class="crosslink">the Planewalker</a>. </p>
                <p>Born from the body of a dormant Titan, the Planewalker wielded their potent energies.</p>
                    <blockquote>"The Planewalker is essentially Vostera's Jesus."<br><cite>Igor Tasic</cite></blockquote> 
                <p>She emerged as a beacon of leadership, guiding the burgeoning civilizations and founding the Ashir Empire from humble origins. Her long and prosperous life was dedicated to teaching the art of spellweaving to those gifted with the same arcane abilities. Revered as the original and first spellweaver, it is believed that all spellweavers are the descendants of the Planewalker, carrying her legacy throughout the ages.</p>

                <h1>History of Vostera</h1>
                <h2>The Age of Titans</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>In the ancient past, Vostera was a world dominated by the Titans, colossal beings of aether, nature, and light. These majestic creatures roamed the land, shaping it with their immense power. They were not fully conscious beings but possessed an instinctive desire to absorb the radiant light of Sola, The Sunmother. The Titans' movements caused great awe and sometimes fear among the humanoid inhabitants, who revered them as living embodiments of cosmic forces. Life on Vostera flourished in harmony with the Titans, and the people had no need for gods or deities.</p>

                <h2>Technological Advancement</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>As time passed, Vostera's humanoid civilizations developed impressive technological advancements. Harnessing the abundant magical energy emanating from the Titans, they created machines, devices, and spells that greatly improved their quality of life. Titans were revered as a source of limitless power, and there was no need to rely on prayers or divine intervention when the people could wield aether and magic themselves. </p>

                <h2>The Captivity of Titans</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>The thirst for power and technological progress eventually led to a desire to control and harness the Titans' energy on a grander scale. Several capital cities sought to capture and immobilize the mighty primordial Titans, which had natural weaknesses that could be exploited. In a swift and efficient operation, the Titans were captured, and their energy was harnessed to power cities and fuel advancements. 

                <h2>Discovery and Betrayal</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>As the Titans were subdued, a dark secret was unveiled by Roshan Hunfrid, a researcher on titan biology. He made a groundbreaking discovery that the Titans were not mindless beings but could feel pain, suffering, pleasure, and desire. His research threatened to expose the truth about the Titans' captivity, which was being kept hidden from the public. Pressured to keep his findings secret, Roshan faced a terrible fate as he was murdered, and his research was destroyed. </p>

                <h2>Aylin Ashir's Revelation</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>His wife, Aylin Ashir, a researcher in aetherology, was devastated by her husband's death and determined to seek the truth. She delved deeper into her research and eventually stumbled upon the potential to create a powerful anti-magic bomb using refined aetherates, the material derived from the Titans. Horrified by the exploitation of Titans and the chaotic state of the world, Aylin resolved that the only solution was to start anew.</p> 

                <h2>The Cataclysm - Titanfall</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>Aylin kidnapped several children of different species and retreated to the heart of a dormant Titan. There, she unleashed the devastating anti-magic bomb she had crafted, now known as Titanfall. The impact of Titanfall rendered magic unusable all over Vostera, plunging the world into darkness and chaos. The ensuing shockwave devastated the continent of Eloran, causing massive wildfires and ejecting debris into the atmosphere, leading to a nuclear winter that killed off much of the remaining life on Vostera.</p> 

                <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>Approximately a thousand years later, Aylin and her kidnapped children emerged from the Titan's remains to find a world that had become cold and lifeless. The survivors, now faced with the bleak reality, formed a small village at the center of the now healed Eloran continent. Aylin realized that the only way to prevent a repetition of the past was to control the spread of information and knowledge about aether and magic. She fashioned a complex web of lies, portraying the Titans as mindless and dangerous, and magic as a gift bestowed upon the chosen by gods. She concealed the truth about the old world, manipulating her children and followers to keep the secrets hidden. </p>

                <h2>The Birth of the Ashir Empire</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>Aylin left her daughter, Nola Ashir, with the responsibility of establishing an organization to enforce control over the use of magic and to propagate the belief in the gods. Thus, the Ashir Empire was born, based on deception and a carefully constructed narrative. The truth of Vostera's history was hidden away, while Aylin's descendants maintained power, controlling knowledge and maintaining the ignorance that Aylin believed would protect Vostera from repeating its tragic past.</p> 

                <h2>The Veil of Ignorance</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>For centuries, Vostera remained enveloped in the veil of ignorance. The survivors of Titanfall, along with the descendants of Aylin, spread across the continents, adhering to the revised history and beliefs. The old world and its secrets were buried deep within the confines of Aylin's legacy, ensuring that the cataclysmic event of Titanfall would be forgotten, and the true nature of the Titans would remain a mystery. The Planewalker's revelation was lost to time, as the people of Vostera embraced their new understanding of history and the world they inhabited.</p>
