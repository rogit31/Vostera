                <h1>Layla, The Nightmaiden</h1>
                <p>Layla, the Nightmaiden is the goddess of the night, of the hunt, the woods, of animals, of introspection and peace.</p> 
                <h2 id="2">Lua and Layla</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>As Lua's sister, they fight for their time in the sky during their mother's absence.</p>
                <h2 id="3">Representation</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>Layla is one of the more enigmatic deities of the Vosteran pantheon. In iconography she is often represented as a massive serpent with scales as dark as the night sky, or as a tall woman of olive skin carrying bow and arrow wearing a black mask.</p>
                <p>Layla's cult is small but dedicated, consisting mostly of those who live in the woods and hunt for their livelihood. Her followers believe in self-reliance, independence, and the importance of solitude and introspection in order to connect with nature and the divine. They see the forest as a place of mystery and magic, where Layla's presence is strongest.</p>
                <h2 id="4">Philosophy</h2>
                <hr class="solid">
                <p>Layla's philosophy is one of balance, harmony, and respect for nature. She teaches that everything in the world is connected, and that every action has a consequence. Her followers strive to live in harmony with the natural world, using its resources wisely and only taking what they need. They also believe in the importance of solitude and introspection, as a way to connect with the divine and understand their place in the world.</p>
