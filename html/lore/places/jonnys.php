                <p>Jonny's is an armory and weaponry store in <a href="../places/onarx.php" class="crosslink">Onarx</a>. It offers all kinds of products including all of the basic equipment adventurers and hunters beginning in their career would ever want. (Most standard adventuring equipment is available here at a standard price). They also have some special enchanted equipment that is available only with verification of being affiliated with the academy. They also on rare occasions have well constructed non-magical +1 weapons/shields/armor so on. Jonny's is most well known for having extremely whacky and out of the ordinary weapons/armor. </p>
